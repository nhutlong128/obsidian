- Consider a [[Vector Space]] V = (V, +, ·) and set of vectors A = {x1, . . . , xk} ⊆ V. 
- If every vector v ∈ V can be expressed as a [[Linear Combination]] of x1, . . . , xk, A is called a [[Generating Set]] of V
- The set of all [[Linear Combination]] of vectors in A is called the [[Span]] of A.
- We can written them as V = span[A]
