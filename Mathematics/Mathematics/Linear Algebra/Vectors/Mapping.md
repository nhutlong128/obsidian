- A [[Mapping]] Φ : V → W preserves the structure of the vector space if 
	- Φ(x + y) = Φ(x) + Φ(y)
	- Φ(λx) = λΦ(x)
	- for all x, y ∈ V and λ ∈ R

- [[Mapping]] is called:
	- [[Injective Mapping]] ∀x, y ∈ V : Φ(x) = Φ(y) ⇒ x = y
	- [[Surjective Mapping]] Φ(V) = W (every element in W can be “reached” from V using Φ)
	- [[Bijective Mapping]] if it is [[Injective Mapping]] and [[Surjective Mapping]] (A bijective Φ can be “undone”, i.e., there exists a mapping Ψ : W → V so that Ψ ◦ Φ(x) = x ~ inverse mapping)
