# Definition
- Let V be a vector space, x0 ∈ V and U ⊆ V a subspace. 
- Then the subset L = x0 + U := {x0 + u : u ∈ U} = {v ∈ V |∃u ∈ U : v = x0 + u} ⊆ V
- Then L is called [[Affine Subspace]]
- x0 is called [[Support Point]], U is called [[Direction Space]]

# Additions
- [[Affine Subspace]] is often described by [[Parameter]]
- Consider a k-dimensional affine space L = x0 + U of V 
- If (b1, . . . , bk) is an ordered [[Basis]] of U, then every element x ∈ L can be uniquely described as
	- x = x0 + λ1b1 + . . . + λkbk
	- where λ1, . . . , λk ∈ R. This representation is called [[Parametric Equation]] of L with [[Direction Vector]] b1, . . . , bk and [[Parameter]] λ1, . . . , λk.
