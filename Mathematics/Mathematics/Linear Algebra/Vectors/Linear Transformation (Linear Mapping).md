- For vector spaces V, W, a [[Mapping]] Φ : V → W is called a [[Linear Transformation (Linear Mapping)]] if
	-   ∀x, y ∈ V ∀λ, ψ ∈ R : Φ(λx + ψy) = λΦ(x) + ψΦ(y)
- [[Linear Transformation (Linear Mapping)]] is [[Isomorphism]] cause Φ : V → W linear and [[Bijective Mapping]] => Can be represented by [[Matrix Representation]]
- [[Linear Transformation (Linear Mapping)]] is [[Automorphism]] cause Φ : V → V linear and [[Bijective Mapping]] => Can be represented by [[Matrix Representation]]

### Linear transformation with Image, Kernel
- Let us consider A ∈ R^(m×n) and a linear mapping Φ : Rn → Rm, x → Ax
-  For A = [a1, . . . , an], where a_i are the columns of A, we obtain Im(Φ) = {Ax : x ∈ R n } = span[a1, . . . , an] ⊆ R^m
-  Which mean, the [[Span]] of [a1, ..., an] is [[Image (Range)]]
