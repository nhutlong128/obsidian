##### Vector definition
Any object is called vector if:
	- obj_a + obj_b = obj_c (is the same kind of obj_a + obj_b)
	- obj_a x scalar = obj_d (is the same kind of obj_a)

### Question

1. A set V with two operations ~ (V, +, .) is called Vector Space if and only if?
#card
- Two operations +, . in V are Closure
- Two operations +, . in V are distributivity
- + in V is Associativity, Commutativity, having Inverse Element and Neutral Element
- . in V is Associativity, having Neutral Element

2. What does it mean by saying Two operations + and . in set V are Closure?
#card 
- + : V × V → V
- · : R × V → V

3. What does it mean by saying two operations + and . in set V are distributivity?
#card 
- ∀λ ∈ R, x, y ∈ V : λ · (x + y) = λ · x + λ · y 
- ∀λ, ψ ∈ R, x ∈ V : (λ + ψ) · x = λ · x + ψ · x 

4. What does it mean by saying operation + in set V is associativity?
#card 
∀λ, ψ ∈ R, x ∈ V : λ+(ψ+x) = (λ+ψ)+x

5. What does it mean by saying operation x in set V is commutativity?
#card 
∀x, y ∈ V: x + y = y + x

6. What does it mean by saying there is neutral element with respect to operation . in set V?
#card 
∀x, ∃y ∈ V: x . y = y . x = x

7. What does it mean by saying there is inverse element with respect to operation + in set V?
#card 
∀x, ∃y ∈ V: x + y = 0

8. What does it mean by saying there is inverse element with respect to operation . in set V?
#card 
∀x, ∃y ∈ V: x . y = 1

9. A set V = (V, +) is called Group if and only if?
#card 
- The result of operation + within two element of V is still closure of V
- The operation + is Associativity
- There exist neutral element
- There exist inverse element

10. A set V = (V, +) is called Abelian Group if and only if?
#card 
- Set V is a Group
- The operation + is Commutativity
