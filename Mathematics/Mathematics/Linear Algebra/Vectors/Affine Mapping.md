- Is [[Linear Transformation (Linear Mapping)]] but + [[Translation Vector]]
- For two [[Vector Space]] V, W, a [[Linear Transformation (Linear Mapping)]] Φ : V → W, and a ∈ W, the mapping
	- φ : V → W : x → a + Φ(x)
	- is an [[Affine Mapping]] from V to W. The vector a is called the [[Translation Vector]] of φ
