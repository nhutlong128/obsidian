- Consider two [[Vector Space]] V, W with corresponding (ordered) [[Basis]] B = (b1, . . . , bn) and [[Basis]] C = (c1, . . . , cm). 
- Moreover, we consider a [[Linear Transformation (Linear Mapping)]] Φ : V → W. For j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, Φ(bj ) = α1jc1 + · · · + αmjcm is the unique representation of Φ(bj ) with respect to C. 
- Then, we call the m × n-matrix A_Φ, whose elements are given by A_Φ(i, j) = αij , the [[Transpose Matrix]] of Φ (with respect to the ordered bases B of V and C of W).
