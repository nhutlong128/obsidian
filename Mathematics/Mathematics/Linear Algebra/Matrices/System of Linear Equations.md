### Note
##### System of Linear Equations definition
- [[System of Linear Equations]] can be used to formalize complex problems
- The example of [[System of Linear Equations]]:
	x_1		+	x_2	+	x_3		=	3	(1)
	x_1		-	x_2	+	2x_3	=	2	(2)
	2x_1				+	3x_3	=	1	(3)

##### System of Linear Equations Form
- [[System of Linear Equations Form]]

##### System of Linear Equations Variable
- [[Basic Variable]]
- [[Free Variable]]

##### Solving System of Linear Equations
- Given Ax = 0
- ![[Pasted image 20210709194403.png]]
- Apply [[Elementary Transformations]] 
- Achived the matrix A as [[Reduced Row-Echelon Form]]
- The solutions of Ax = 0 can be found by two ways:
	- 1st way: The solution is express [[Non-Pivot]] column as [[Linear Combination]] of [[Pivot]] columns on the left of it.
	- 2nd way: Use [[Minus-1 Trick]]
	- Result: ![[Pasted image 20210709195903.png]]
