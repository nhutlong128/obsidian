- Consider a [[Vector Space]] V, a [[Vector Subspace]] U. Every [[Vector]] belongs to [[Vector Space]] V can be projected into [[Vector Subspace]] U which mean can be expressed by [[Linear Combination]] of [[Basis]] b1,...., bn of [[Vector Subspace]] U. The [[Projection Matrix]] P is:
	- P = B x (B^T x B)^âˆ’1 x B^T
