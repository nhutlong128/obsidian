### Note
##### Group Definition
- A set G with operation X (can be written as G := (G,X)) is a [[Group]] if:
	- Closure of G under X operation: With x, y belongs to G, x X y still belongs to G
	- Associativity: With x, y, z belongs to G, (x X y) X z = x X (y X z)
	- Neutral Element: Exist e, all x belongs to G that x X e = x and e X x = x
	- Inverse element: Exist y, all x belongs to G that x X y = e and y X x = e
