### Notes
- The **main idea** behind the **flex layout** is to give the container the ability to **alter** its itemsâ€™ width/height (and order) to **best fill** the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes).

- ## Properties for the Parent  (flex container)
	- #### display

	- #### flex-direction
		- Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept.

	- #### flex-wrap
		- By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.

- ## Properties for the Children (flex items)
	- #### flex-grow
		- ![[Pasted image 20210520164806.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20210520164812.png]]
		- If all items have `flex-grow` set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others (or it will try to, at least).
	- #### align-self
		- ![[Pasted image 20210520164842.png]]
		- This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by `align-items`) to be overridden for individual flex items.
