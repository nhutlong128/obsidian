# Problem solve
- [[Sparse Data]]

# Implemented with

#  Data type support
- [[RecordIO-wrapped protoburf - Float32]]

# How is it should be used

# Data reading mode
- [[File reading mode]] ~ read all in once
- [[Pipe reading mode]] ~ read in batch

# Instance support type
- [[Single CPU]]
- [[Single GPU]] only works with dense data
