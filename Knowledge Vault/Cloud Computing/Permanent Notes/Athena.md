### Notes
- [[Athena]] helps us run [[SQL]] command without provisioning any servers, against data sits in [[S3]] with the help of schema defined from [[Glue Data Catalog]]
- [[Serverless]]
- Support:
	- [[CSV]]
	- [[JSON]]
	- [[ORC]]
	- [[Parquet]]
	- [[Avro]]
- [[Visualization]] and [[Highly formatted Report]] would be great for [[Athena]], if doing any ETL task use [[Glue]] instead
