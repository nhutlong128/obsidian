### Notes
- A [[Binary Tree]] is a tree that every node has the maximum of two children node
- A [[Complete Binary Tree]]
- If [[Binary Tree]] is represented as an array Arr[]:
	- The root node is Arr[0]
	- The i_th node is Arr[i]
	- The parent node of i_th node is Arr[(i-1)/2]
	- The left child node of i_th node is Arr[(i*2)+1]
	- The right child node of i_th node is Arr[(i*2)+2]
